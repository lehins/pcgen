{-# LANGUAGE Safe #-}

-- | This module contains a permuted linear congruential pseudorandom number
-- generator, as described by M.E. O'Neill (<pcg-random.org>). This version
-- holds two 'Word64' values and outputs a 'Word32' of randomness each time you
-- use it. Compared to the 'StdGen' type from "System.Random", it's around a
-- 2.5x to 3x speedup on a 64-bit system. It runs somewhat slower than @StdGen@
-- on a 32-bit system (the @Word64@ values must be emulated after all), but
-- there aren't too many of those in play these days anyway. Raspberry Pi is the
-- only common thing I can think of, which isn't the best for Haskell in the
-- first place. If you somehow are using 32-bit all the time I guess this module
-- isn't for you.
--
-- The first @Word64@ is the @state@, which changes with each step of the
-- generator. The second @Word64@ is the @inc@, which stays fixed from step to
-- step and controls what stream of numbers is generated. The @inc@ is always
-- bitwise OR'd with 1 during computations, so there are only 2^63 distinct
-- number streams (eg: @inc@ 2 and 3 are the same number stream). The @state@
-- value eventually returns to it's initial value after 2^64 uses and the whole
-- sequence loops around.
